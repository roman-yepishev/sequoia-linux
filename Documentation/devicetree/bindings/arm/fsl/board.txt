Freescale Reference Board Bindings

This document describes device tree bindings for various devices that
exist on some Freescale reference boards.

* Freescale on-board FPGA connected to IFC controller

Some Freescale boards like LS2085AQDS/LS2085ARDB have an on-board FPGA/CPLD
connected to the IFC controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be a board-specific string followed by a string
  indicating the type of FPGA.  Example:
	"fsl,ls2085a-qds-qixis", "fsl,fpga-qixis"
	"fsl,ls2085a-rdb-qixis", "fsl,fpga-qixis"
- reg: The register set for the device

Example:
	&ifc {
		status = "okay";
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells <1>;
		ranges = <0x3 0x0 0x5 0x20000000 0x00010000>;

		cpld@3,0 {
			compatible = "fsl,ls2085a-qds-qixis", "fsl,fpga-qixis";
			reg = <0x3 0 0x10000>;
		};
	};
